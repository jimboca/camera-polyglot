This node server is intended to support any type of camera.  See <A href="https://github.com/jimboca/camera-polyglot/blob/master/README.md">camera-polyglot README</a> for more information</p>

<b>Creating the node server.</b>

<ol>
  <li>Download the profile by selecting the button near the top of this page.
  <li>Install node server on the ISY controller.
  <ol>
    <li>Select 'Node Server' -> 'Configure' and select one of the empty slots which must be the same as the 'Node Server ID' used when this Node Server as created on polyglot.<br>
    <li>Profile Name: Can be anything, but it is recommended to use the same 'Name' you gave the polyglot node server.
    <li>User: The Pologlot server user name
    <li>Password: The Pologlot server password
    <li>Base URL: Copy/Paste the 'Base URL' above for this node server.
    <li>Host Name: Is the host name or ip address for the machine running polyglot
    <li>Port: The polyglot server port, default is 8080 unless you changed it.
    <li>Timeout: The default of 0 is fine?
    <li>ISY User: The ISY User number to use when communicating, 0 is always admin?
    <li>Select 'Upload Profile' and find the file you downloaded in Step 1.
    <li>Click OK.
    <li>If this is the first time the profile was loaded, or the profile has changed, you must reboot the ISY with the ISY Configuration -> Reboot option.
  </ol>
  <li>Currently config information for some cameras is in a seperate file.  While waiting for the ISY to reboot review the config file and change the settings.
  <li>Once the ISY reboots, click the 'Resart Server' button near the top of this page.
  <li>You should then see a 'Camera Server' node on the ISY.  This node manages communication with the main polyglot camera node server.
  <li>Select the 'Camera Server' node, and set the options appropriate for your network.
  <ol>
    <li>Foscam MPEG Search.  Set to off to not poll for these cameras, or select the desired time.  I am assuming a longer time may be necessary when you have a lot of cameras, but 10 seconds works fine for my 3 cameras.
  </ol>
  <li>Click the 'Discover' button, this will re-read the config and poll for cameras if necessary and add them all.
</ol>

<b>Debugging</b>
<p>You should now see your cameras. If not:
<ul>
  <li>Check the polyglot log by clicking the 'View Log' button on the left of this page.
  <li>Check the node server log file which is stored your polyglot config directory under camera-polyglot/name.log where name is what you called it.
</ul>
